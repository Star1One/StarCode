### 💡 How It Works

- User input is stored as a raw expression array

- The display shows a formatted version of the numbers

- When = is pressed:

-   The expression is parsed into numbers and operators

-   The calculation runs left-to-right

-   The result is rounded to avoid floating-point errors

- After calculation:

-   Pressing a number starts a new calculation

-   Pressing an operator continues from the result

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

Operations are evaluated left-to-right

```
  2 + 3 × 4 = 20
```
